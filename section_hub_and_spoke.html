      ⁠</a>3. Hub&amp;Spoke model</h2></div></div></div><div class="para">
			One of the biggest changes introduced with the rewrite of the Anaconda installer was that the new UI (both graphical and textual) uses a hub&amp;spoke model <a id="idx_hub_and_spoke" class="indexterm"></a> instead of the wizard model that had been used before. The following diagram shows how hub&amp;spoke works regarding the possible transitions between screens (hubs and spokes).
		</div><div class="figure"><a id="fig_hub_and_spoke">
      ⁠</a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="picture_hub_and_spoke">
      ⁠</a><object data="images/hub_and_spoke.svg" type="image/svg+xml"><img src="images/hub_and_spoke.png" alt="" /></object></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1. Hub&amp;spoke model diagram</strong></p></div><div class="para">
			The screens 2, 3, 5, 8, 10 and others are examples of so called <span class="emphasis"><em>normal spokes</em></span>. Those are the screens reachable from hubs. The screens 1 and 14 are examples of a so called <span class="emphasis"><em>standalone spoke</em></span> which is a type of screen that should be used only in case it has to be visited before (after) the following (previous) standalone spoke or hub. <a id="idm242240206928">
      ⁠</a><a xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" href="#ftn.idm242240206928" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a> The examples of such screens are the language and network configuration screens in the Anaconda installer that are implemented as standalone spokes because actions available on them have to and should, respectively, take place before all the other actions controlled from the user interface.
		</div><div class="para">
			The reason for the Hub&amp;Spoke model being used in the Anaconda installer's UI is that it has many advantages:
		</div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					users are not forced to go through the screens in some strictly defined order,
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					users are not forced to visit every screen no matter if they understand what the options configured in it mean or not,
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					it is good for the transactional mode where all desired values can be set while nothing is actually happening to the underlying machine until a special button is clicked,
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					it provides way to show an overview of the configured values,
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					it has a great support for extensibility, because additional spokes can be put on hubs without need to reorder anything and resolve some complex ordering dependencies and
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					it can be used for both graphical and textual mode of the installer.
				</div></li></ul></div><div class="para">
			As can be seen in <a class="xref" href="section_hub_and_spoke.html#fig_hub_and_spoke">Figure 1, “Hub&amp;spoke model diagram”</a> central points of the Hub&amp;Spoke model are hubs, so let's focus on hubs in the Anaconda installer for a while. Currently there are two of them:
		</div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					the Summary hub <a id="idx_summary_hub" class="indexterm"></a> that shows a summary of configured options and
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					the Progress hub <a id="idx_progress_hub" class="indexterm"></a> that shows the progress of the installation process and also shows a summary of options that can be configured during the actual installation being done in the background thread.
				</div></li></ul></div><div class="para">
			Every spoke has a few predefined properties that are reflected on the hub. There are: the <span class="property"> ready </span> property stating whether the spoke can be visited or not, the <span class="property"> completed </span> property marking the spoke as completed (all required values are set) or not, the <span class="property"> mandatory </span> property telling whether the spoke has to be completed before allowing user continue to the next hub or standalone spoke and the <span class="property"> status </span> property providing a short summary of the values set in the spoke. <a id="idx_spoke_properties" class="indexterm"></a> To make the layout of the UI clearer, spokes reachable from these two hubs are grouped together to so called <span class="emphasis"><em> categories </em></span>. <a id="idx_category" class="indexterm"></a> A good example of a category used in the Anaconda installer is the <span class="emphasis"><em> Localization </em></span> <a id="idx_local_cat" class="indexterm"></a> category that groups together spokes for keyboard and timezone settings. So to sum it up there are hubs on the hubs there are categories and in the categories there are spokes. Every spoke contains UI controls that show and allow to modify values from one or more subtrees of the in-memory representation of the kickstart file. As we will see in <a class="xref" href="section_writing_addon.html">Section 6, “Writing an Anaconda addon”</a> the same applies to addons.

				Screens mentioned in the rest of this section are screens from the graphical mode of the installation.
